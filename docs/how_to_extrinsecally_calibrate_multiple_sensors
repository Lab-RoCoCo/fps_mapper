1) record a bag with all sensors
   - tf (nominal)

   -topic of interest
    - depth/image_raw
    - depth/camera_info

   - odom (for later)

2) when recording the bag stand still for some seconds at the beginning
   tecord the  bag in an environment rich in structure, where you
   are sure that the *depth-only* mapping will work out

3) from the bag, generate a dump file containing the relevant infos by playing the bag and letting
   the following node running

   ps_message_dumper_node -t depth1/image_raw> -t depth2_image_raw -base_link_frame_id /base_link -o output.dump.txt   

4) now we need to generate clouds for the *camera_only* slam mechanism, by using the single cameras
   from the file "output.dump.txt" we generated, we can run the tracker

   grep <topic_of_1st_sensor> output.dump.txt > 1st_sensor.txt
   grep <topic_of_2nd_sensor> output.dump.txt > 2nd_sensor.txt

   ps_tracker_gui_app -cam_only -bpr 1 -o 1st_sensor 1st_sensor.txt
   When you see some structure you have seen with the 2nd sensor, press s (and ignore the message on the screen)
   this will save a cloud 1st_sensor-00000.cloud
   if you press "S" multiple times you will save multiple clouds
   R for reset.

   Stop as early as you see a decent amount of maop seen by the  2nd sensor

   Repeat the procedure with the 2nd sensor
   
4) align the clouds from the different sensors
   ps_aligner_gui <cloud1> <cloud2> ...

   you will see a guy with the clouds of the different sensors misaligned.
   
   With "shift-click" you select a cloud (might take a while depending on your video card)
   
   With "M" you toggle the move mode, that moves the clouds with the cursor-keys and pgup/dwn (ctrl for rotating)

   Using this put  acloud onto the other, roughly

   To refine the process, click on both clouds and press "M".

   This will match the clouds with icp
   
   With "P" you print the transforms of all clouds (t + ed quaternions), on the shell
   the forst cloud should be 0 0 0 0 0 0

   The numbers you find in the 2nd cloud are the relative alignment between the teo clouds,
   and thus the two sensors
